ITiN  - InfoPath Testing in .net
====



ItiN is a framework for the testing of InfoPath forms. It is derived from the WatiN testing framework which is used for testing web applications.

ItiN needs Visual Studio 2005 and InfoPath 2003 with the .Net programability support installed to work. You may have some trouble with the references, but it should be OK.

ItiN is a derived work from [WatiN](http://watin.sourceforge.net)

Itin was built by Bruce McLeod, if you have any questions you can contact me via my [site](http://www.teknologika.com/) and then click on Contact.
